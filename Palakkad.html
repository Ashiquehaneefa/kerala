        <h1>About Palakkad</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          Palakkad, or Palghat, is a city in Kerala, a state in southwestern
          India. The 18th-century Palakkad Fort has sturdy battlements, a moat
          and a Hanuman temple on its grounds. North, on the Kalpathy River, the
          15th-century Viswanatha Swamy Temple is the main venue of the famous
          Ratholsavam chariot festival. Northeast, near Malampuzha Dam, the town
          of Malampuzha has a rock garden created from recycled materials.
